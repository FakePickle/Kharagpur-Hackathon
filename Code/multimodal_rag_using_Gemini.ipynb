        "\n",
        "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge sources before generating responses. This approach ensures relevant and accurate output. In today's data-rich world, documents often combine text and images to convey information comprehensively. However, most Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems overlook the valuable insights locked within images. As Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) gain prominence, it's crucial to explore how we can leverage visual content alongside text in RAG, unlocking a deeper understanding of the information landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multimodal RAG** is an advanced form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that goes beyond text to incorporate various data types like images, charts, and tables. This expanded capability allows for a deeper understanding of complex information, leading to more accurate and informative outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Two options for Multimodal RAG\n",
        "1. **Multimodal Embeddings** -\n",
        "The multimodal embeddings model generates vectors based on the input you provide, which can include a combination of image, text, and video data. The image embedding vector and text embedding vector are in the same semantic space with the same dimensionality. Consequently, these vectors can be used interchangeably for use cases like searching image by text, or searching video by image.\n",
        "Utilize multimodal embeddings to integrate text and images, retrieve relevant content through similarity search, and then provide both the raw image and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis.\n",

        "2. **Text Embeddings** -\n",
        "Generate text summaries of images using a multimodal LLM, embed and retrieve the text, and then pass the text chunks to the LLM for answer synthesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Comparing text-based and multimodal RAG\n",
        "Multimodal RAG offers several advantages over text-based RAG:\n",
        "- **Enhanced knowledge access**: Multimodal RAG can access and process both textual and visual information, providing a richer and more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.\n",
        "- **Improved reasoning capabilities**: By incorporating visual cues, multimodal RAG can make better informed inferences across different types of data modalities.\n",

        "- Comprehensive Understanding: Processes multiple data formats for a better picture.\n",

        "In one word **“No”**. Gemini 1.5, with a 1M context length window, has sparked a new debate about whether RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is still relevant or not. LLMs commonly struggle with hallucination. To address this challenge, two solutions were introduced, one involving an increased context window and the other utilizing RAG. Gemini 1.5 outperforms Claude 2.1 and GPT-4 Turbo as it can assimilate entire code bases, process over 100 papers, and various documents, but it surely hasn’t killed RAG.\n",

        "RAG leverages your private knowledge database for effective Q&A while ensuring the security of sensitive information like trade secrets, confidential IP, GDPR-protected data, and internal documents. For more detailed insights explore our article on Private RAG with Connected Data Sources using Mistral, Ollama, and Pathway [here](/developers/templates/private-rag-ollama-mistral).\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally in traditional RAG pipelines, you can enhance performance by tweaking the retrieval process, changing the embedding model, adjusting chunking strategies, or improving source data. However, with a \"stuff-the-context-window-1M-tokens\" strategy, your only option is to improve the source data since all data is given to the model within the token limit. Additionally the context window may be filled with many relevant facts, but 40% or more of them are “lost” to the model. If you want to make sure the model is actually using the context you are sending it, you are best off curating it first and only sending the most relevant context. In other words, doing traditional RAG.\n",
